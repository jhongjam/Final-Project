        <h2> About the author</h2>
          <p> Hello, welcome to my site. I, the author, am named Jimmy Jhong. For my entire life, I have had an intense passion
          for animals. However, in all my studies and observations I have grown a particular affinity towards animals of the 
          <i> Canis lupus familiaris </i> variety, or more commonly known as dogs. I have spent my life growing up around members of
          the <i> Canis lupus familiaris </i> variety, and I have come to grow even stronger affinities towards certain pedigrees.
          I would like to elaborate on the varieties I have particular interest in within this page.
