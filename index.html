          <h2 style= "color: slateblue;"> About the author</h2>
          <p> Hello, welcome to my site. I, the author, am named Jimmy Jhong. For my entire life, I have had an intense passion
          for animals. However, in all my studies and observations I have grown a particular affinity towards animals of the 
          <i> Canis lupus familiaris </i> variety, or more commonly known as dogs. I have spent my life growing up around members of
          the <i> Canis lupus familiaris </i> variety, and I have come to grow even stronger affinities towards certain pedigrees.
          I would like to elaborate on the varieties I have particular interest in within this page.

         <h2 style= "color: slateblue;"> Yorkshire Terrier </h2>
         <img height=256 width=348 src="yorkiehtml.jpg">
         <p> The Yorkshire Terrier; What an interesting animal. And what's even more interesting is that these beautiful dogs have human like hair
             instead of fur! They lack the same nostril-tickling dander that most dogs have, and they also do not leave hairs behind on everything
             they happen to lay down on.As cute and pampered as they are in today's society, they originially
             bred for hunting purposes. They served as rat catchers in mines and were often used to burrow underground in search of badgers
             and foxes underground. Just incredible. 
             To my surprise, these instincts are still intact in even the most adorable housepets.
             My aunt has two Yorkshire Terriers. One of them attacks anything that resembles a small rodent (any animalistic toy) 
             and shakes it in its jaws. The other one always digs at her bed when she enters it. I haven't seeen her outside, but I have
             a feeling that she would uproot every plant in the garden. Multiple members of my family have owned the treasured, so I've
             grown quite an attachment to them as I've spent my whole life around them. The principles these little dogs represent attracts me to them the most.
             If I was to be reborn into a dog, I can almost guarantee you that I would be a Yorkshire terrier. These dogs take the saying
             "It doesn't matter how big you are, it matters how big your heart is" to the limit. I am not a big, burly man like many of
             my distant Mongolian ancestors; I come in the modest size of 164 cm. But I somewhat see myself in these dogs. 
             I characterize my size and value in this world, based off my actions, not my appearance. </p>
